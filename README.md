# Professional-portfolio


Here is everything I was able to accomplish on this professional portfolio.

## Header

I was able to make a header and a nav bar with active links, this is also responsive and enables the hover feature


## Content

I added images and did flex box to the best of my ability, but I redid a lot of my code near the end to make it cleaner. 
The "about me, work and contact me" sections all have the proper sizing, font and color, however I was not able to make them a responsive grid.
I attempted to fix the links on the contact me footer
